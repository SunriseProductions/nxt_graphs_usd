# How to guide for the usd library 

The usd library graphs are built up with a few layers that each 
hold some core node for building up usd assets. 

These single nodes when combined(parented or strung together)
 can build more complicated usd concepts. Please see the examples in this git repo
 for reference.

# Core layers

### pxr_usd
### pxr_usd_geom
### pxr_usd_variants
### pxr_usd_model_api
### pxr_usd_tools

# Example Layers

 - HelloWorld.nxt
 - HelloWorldRedux.nxt
